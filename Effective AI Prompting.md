## Exercise 1 – Your First Prompts

### Scenario 1: Polite Email Declining a Party Invitation

#### Poor Prompt
“Write me an email saying I can’t come.”

#### Good Prompt
“Write a polite and friendly email declining a party invitation. Keep the tone warm and appreciative, mention that I already have a prior commitment, and thank the host for inviting me.”

#### Comparison
- The poor prompt is vague and forces the AI to guess tone, context, and intention.  
- The good prompt is specific, sets the tone, defines the reason for declining, and clearly states the desired communication style — resulting in a much more accurate and useful email.

### Scenario 2: Explain Photosynthesis With Audience + Format

#### Good Prompt
“Explain photosynthesis to middle-school students using simple, accessible language. Present the explanation in bullet points and finish with one analogy that compares photosynthesis to something in daily life.”

This uses audience specification, formatting requirements, and clarity — essential parts of strong prompt engineering.

### Scenario 3: Recipe Suggestions With Ingredients + Restrictions

#### Good Prompt
“I have chicken, rice, tomatoes, onions, and spinach. I’m lactose-intolerant and a beginner cook. Suggest 3 easy recipes using only these ingredients. Include quick step-by-step instructions for each.”

This includes constraints, cooking level, ingredients, and required format, which leads to highly specific and relevant outputs.

## Pair Discussion Reflection

The good prompts are clearer because they include context, task, audience, tone, and formatting details.

- Weak prompts lacked clarity, tone, restrictions, or purpose, which often causes irrelevant or low-quality responses.  
- Prompts can be improved by adding missing constraints, specifying the output format, defining the target audience, and using step-by-step requirements to guide the AI.

## Exercise 2 – Problem-Solving With AI  
### Scenario A: Event Planning (Chosen Scenario)

Planning a team-building event for 20 people with a $500 budget.

Below is the full prompting strategy using role assignment, constraints, prompt chaining, step-by-step instructions, and iterative refinement — all based on the prompt-engineering concepts provided.

---

### Prompt 1 – Initial Exploration (Context + Task)
“Act as a professional event planner. Suggest several team-building event ideas for 20 people with a strict total budget of $500. Include a short description of the venue type, main activity, food approach, and approximate cost.”

**Purpose:** Generate options using role-playing + constraints.

---

### Prompt 2 – Filtering (Constraints + Refinement)
“Remove any event ideas that exceed $500 total or cost more than $25 per person. Keep only the realistic options.”

**Purpose:** Narrow down choices using constraint filtering.

---

### Prompt 3 – Cost Breakdown (Step-By-Step Structure)
“For the best remaining idea, create a detailed cost breakdown. Include venue, materials, food, activity costs, and the final total.”

**Purpose:** Force transparency and reasoning.

---

### Prompt 4 – Optimization (Iteration + Negative Prompting)
“Improve the selected event plan by offering one indoor and one outdoor variation. Do not increase the total cost. Suggest upgrades that improve engagement while staying under the $500 limit.”

**Purpose:** Refinement + creative problem solving while controlling constraints.

---

### Prompt 5 – Final Product (Format Specification)
“Create a final one-page event itinerary including schedule, required supplies, setup time, activity flow, and closing remarks. Present it using clear headings and bullet points.”

**Purpose:** Request a polished, ready-to-use output formatted for presentation.

## Group Discussion Summary (What We Would Present)

- We used advanced prompting techniques including role assignment, chain-of-thought structuring, iterative refinement, negative prompting, and prompt chaining.  
- We accounted for budget limits, engagement goals, venue types, and logistics.  
- Our prompts show clear progression from **brainstorming → filtering → detailing → optimizing → final formatting**.  
- This demonstrates a full understanding of how to strategically interact with AI to solve real-world planning problems.
