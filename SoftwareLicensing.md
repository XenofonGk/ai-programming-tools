# Lab 10 — Software Licensing

## Introduction
This lab explores how to identify software licenses on GitHub and how to design your own custom license. You will analyze real repositories and then create a license for an original AI project.

## Exercise 1 — License Detective (Solo)

### Objective
Identify and interpret different software licenses used in open-source machine learning projects.

### Instructions
1. Go to **GitHub.com** and search for machine-learning repositories.  
2. Select **5 different projects**, each with a different license type.  
3. For each project, determine:
   - License type (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, etc.)
   - Whether commercial use is allowed
   - Whether attribution is required
   - Whether modification/redistribution is allowed
   - Any special restrictions or requirements  
4. Create a comparison table.

### Sample Comparison Table

| Project | License | Commercial Use | Attribution | Modify/Redistribute | Special Requirements |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Example Project A | MIT | Yes | Yes | Yes | Must include copyright + license notice |
| Example Project B | Apache 2.0 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Must list modifications; includes patent clause |
| Example Project C | BSD-2 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Very few restrictions |
| Example Project D | GPL | Yes | Yes | Yes | Copyleft: derivatives must also be GPL |
| Example Project E | No License | No | N/A | No | Cannot use without permission |

## Exercise 2 — Build Your Own License (Groups of 2)

### Objective
Design a simple custom software license for your AI model.

### Scenario
Your team created an AI system that recognizes emotional tone in text. You want to share it publicly but must define how others can use it.

### Requirements
Your custom license must specify:

1. **Who can use it**  
2. **What they can do** (modify, redistribute, commercial use)  
3. **What they must do** (attribution, share improvements, etc.)  
4. **What they cannot do** (restrictions)  
5. **What happens if the license is violated**

### Deliverable
- A one-page license  
- A brief explanation of your choices

## Sample Custom License

### EmotionSense License v1.0

**Permission:**  
Permission is hereby granted to individuals, researchers, and organizations to use the EmotionSense AI model for personal, educational, and commercial purposes.

**Allowed:**  
- Modify the model and its outputs  
- Redistribute original or modified versions  
- Use in commercial products or services  

**Requirements:**  
- Provide clear attribution: “Based on the EmotionSense Model (v1.0)”  
- Document and share any improvements publicly within 60 days  
- Include this license file with all redistributed copies  

**Prohibited:**  
- Selling the model as-is without modifications  
- Using the model for surveillance, harassment, or discriminatory decision-making  
- Removing attribution or misrepresenting authorship  

**Violation:**  
Failure to comply with this license results in automatic termination of all granted rights. Continued use after termination requires written permission from the creators.

## Explanation (Example)

We allow open use so the model can spread widely, including commercial applications.  
We require attribution to credit original creators.  
We require shared improvements to encourage community benefit (similar to open-source spirit).  
We restrict harmful uses to avoid ethical misuse.  
Termination clause ensures enforceability.
